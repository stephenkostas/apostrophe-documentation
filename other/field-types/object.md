# `object`

An `object` field has its own schema, and is very similar to an [`array`](array.md) field. However there is always exactly one object, represented as an object property of the doc in the database \(a sub-object\).

Using `object` instead of `array` when only dealing with a single object prevents unnecessary prefixing of field names and nesting docs in the form.
