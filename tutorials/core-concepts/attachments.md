# Managing Apostrophe Attachments

There are two types of content that you can display in Apostrophe: content that you created in the CMS, like Pieces; and content that you created outside of the CMS and uploaded to Apostrophe. The various types of content that you can create in Apostrophe are collectively known as ["Docs"](/tutorials/core-concepts/technical-overview.md), and content from outside of Apostrophe that you uploaded are called "Attachments".
