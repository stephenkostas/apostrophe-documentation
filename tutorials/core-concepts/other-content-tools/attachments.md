# Attachments

There are two types of content that you can display in Apostrophe: content that you created in the CMS, like Pieces; and content that you created outside of the CMS and uploaded to Apostrophe. The various types of content that you can create in Apostrophe are collectively known as ["Docs"](/tutorials/core-concepts/technical-overview.md), and docs that have been uploaded to Apostrophe are called "Attachments".

### Attachments and Assets

In Apostrophe, **Attachments** are any file that you upload into the CMS to use as content or provide a download. **Assets** are the CSS and JS stylesheets that you connect to Apostrophe through the file system. It will be important to recognize the difference as you continue through the Apostrophe tutorials and reference material.

## Uploading Attachments

Attachments are uploaded in two ways: through the [Files Widget](/modules/apostrophe-files) included with Apostrophe or through the [`attachments`](/other/fields/attachments.md) field in a custom schema. The Files widget can be accessed by adding it to a page, or through the admin bar.

To learn more about using the `apostrophe-files` you can [its section in the standard widgets documentation](/tutorials/core-concepts/editable-content-on-pages/standard-widgets.md#apostrophe-files).

To add files through the admin bar,

1. Open the admin bar and select *Files*.

2. To add more files, click  *Add Files* in the top left, and select files from your local files system to upload.

3. To delete files, check the box next to each file you want to delete and then click *Batch Trash*.
