# Tags

Tags are a common CMS feature which are used to fluidly connect content. In Apostrophe, tags can applied to all content types and connect them across your site. Many of the widgets bundled with Apostrophe support creating content with tags, and you can also [use tags when you create your own widgets](/other/fields/tags.md).

## Creating Tags

You can create a list of base tags that writers can apply to content through tags administration, or just leave it up to them to create their own tags. To limit user created tags, you can configure the [module settings](/modules/apostrophe-tags). The default configuration allows for user created tags.

To add a tag through the admin bar,

1. Open the admin bar and select *Tags*

2. Enter text in the "Find or add a tag" field. If the tag already exists, you can see it in the list, if not you can add it.

## Managing Tags

All tags can be managed from the Manage Tags page, whether they were created by a regular user or by an administrator. Deleting a tag will remove it from any associated content.

* Click the pencil icon to edit an existing tag.
